# First News article
This is the first article of a monthly/bi-monthly series that aims to inform users of the newest developments in LXQt.

The first edition, will summarize all changes since version 0.17.

## General

- Bumped minimum Qt version to 0.17. (Begone wierd issues that happen with older Qt versions); Thanks @luis-pereira and @adjamhub. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/discussions/1974).
- Updated translations. Many thanks to the translators. 

## PCManFM-Qt
- Better text colors in inactive frame of split view ([#1361](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/pull/1361)).
- Fixed inconsistent item selection with transient filter-bar ([#1373](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/pull/1373)).
- Allow recursive customization of folders ([#1381](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/pull/1381)). This allows a folder configuration (for example list mode), to transfer to all subfolders so that you don't have to do it manually to every single one.
- A new action to remove custom settings of nonexistent folders has been added. When used, a prompt dialog tells the user that they might be useful if the folders were created again. ([#1389](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/pull/1389)).
