The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of libqtxdg 3.7.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/libqtxdg/releases).

Main changes:

  * `QSvgRenderer` is used with a cache for SVG icons, so that LXQt's icon handling could not be broken by intruding icon engines that register themselves for "svg" (like `kiconthemes` 5.80).
 * Allow runtime overriding of detachment of processes by setting `QTXDG_START_DETACH_TRULY`.
 * XTerm is added as a runtime dependency.
 * Code cleanup.

The complete list of changes is available in our CHANGELOG file.
