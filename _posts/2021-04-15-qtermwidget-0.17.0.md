The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of qtermwidget 0.17.0.

Main changes:


 * Dropped the support for KDE3 color scheme formats.
 * Properly implemented the "Action after paste" feature.
 * Added modes for background image. How background images are drawn is changed and manual reconfiguration may be needed. See docs/`configuration.md` for more details.
 * Added a method to disable bracketed paste mode.
 * Fixed the execution after pasting when Ctrl is hold.
